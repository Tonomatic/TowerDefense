# TowerDefense
## TowerDefense is a game under construction, for the MintBean Hackaton. The game will have towers defending a castle from evil mushrooms. As the game increases in difficulty, the user also gets more crystals (money) to buy and place more towers.

## Procedure

### Step 1
Using the library Phaser, by npm i phaser, we are able to use various methods to help facilitate game development. First, we went ahead and intialized a simple html template for phaser and phasers dynamics, including particle manipulation, images and physics. From what I gathered, most phaser games should have 2 functions, which are preload and create.
